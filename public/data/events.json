UK specialty roasters pour samples at booth after booth while equipment brands demonstrate grinders and espresso machines. Panel discussions cover sustainability, direct trade, and café business models with Northern roasters and café owners.\n\nCupping sessions run hourly in the tasting lab. Latte art throwdowns and brewing competitions draw crowds around the main stage. The festival's independent ethos keeps the focus on small-batch roasters and emerging brands rather than large commercial exhibitors.","start_date":"2026-11-20T09:00:00.000Z","end_date":"2026-11-22T18:00:00.000Z","website":"https://www.manchestercoffeefest.com","contact_email":null,"ticket_price":null,"is_free":false,"max_attendees":null,"event_type":"festival","createdAt":"2026-01-15T02:52:26.980Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T03:12:38.583Z","publishedAt":"2026-01-15T03:12:38.762Z","physicalLocation":"Bowlers Exhibition Centre, Manchester","ticketsAvailable":null,"city":{"id":252,"documentId":"j4c4862dawrreae5emmj2yko","name":"Manchester","story":"Manchester's industrial heritage meets modern coffee culture, with converted warehouses housing some of the North's finest roasters.","population":"550000","timezone":"Europe/London","coordinates":[{"lat":53.408290515384614,"lng":-2.3279145364102565},{"lat":53.36937416538461,"lng":-2.2902362364102564},{"lat":53.35241194538462,"lng":-2.3044595664102565},{"lat":53.34813558538462,"lng":-2.3217649864102565},{"lat":53.33894673538462,"lng":-2.3026287264102567},{"lat":53.33059718538462,"lng":-2.3091245564102563},{"lat":53.34113529538461,"lng":-2.2697896564102567},{"lat":53.352248925384615,"lng":-2.2580974264102567},{"lat":53.35103606538461,"lng":-2.240874506410256},{"lat":53.36272070538462,"lng":-2.236632136410256},{"lat":53.39117055538462,"lng":-2.247514656410256},{"lat":53.40316935538462,"lng":-2.209859896410256},{"lat":53.41631105538462,"lng":-2.210776196410256},{"lat":53.435822415384614,"lng":-2.1833995064102565},{"lat":53.43191356538462,"lng":-2.1701237164102563},{"lat":53.44830554538461,"lng":-2.1661736164102563},{"lat":53.460855005384616,"lng":-2.1401700564102564},{"lat":53.47555991538462,"lng":-2.1414348364102564},{"lat":53.48360091538461,"lng":-2.1608756864102565},{"lat":53.503662825384616,"lng":-2.1540571164102564},{"lat":53.51193966538462,"lng":-2.172587496410256},{"lat":53.52534107538462,"lng":-2.1462431564102564},{"lat":53.536024825384615,"lng":-2.1632473964102563},{"lat":53.54125224538461,"lng":-2.2009662864102566},{"lat":53.553802145384616,"lng":-2.216604216410256},{"lat":53.54735328538462,"lng":-2.2702837764102566},{"lat":53.53266421538462,"lng":-2.2665325564102567},{"lat":53.537664705384614,"lng":-2.247316216410256},{"lat":53.52524504538462,"lng":-2.2586693164102565},{"lat":53.51887725538461,"lng":-2.2457572964102566},{"lat":53.50453589538461,"lng":-2.2569719064102562},{"lat":53.49019981538462,"lng":-2.2456591764102565},{"lat":53.47218170538462,"lng":-2.2709819464102563},{"lat":53.462297545384615,"lng":-2.254575996410256},{"lat":53.43581438538461,"lng":-2.306110776410257},{"lat":53.42025543538461,"lng":-2.2769861864102565},{"lat":53.41256324538461,"lng":-2.2815608664102567},{"lat":53.40470231538462,"lng":-2.3034905764102565},{"lat":53.408290515384614,"lng":-2.3279145364102565}],"postal_code":null,"createdAt":"2025-09-18T13:48:19.860Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T07:05:28.092Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-16T07:05:28.184Z","country_name":"United Kingdom","media_links":null,"featured_video_url":null,"comingSoon":true,"beta":null,"inFocus":null,"headline":null,"coffee_guide_articles":null,"rating_stars":null,"slug":null,"statement":null},"image":null,"eventHostBrand":null},{"id":23,"documentId":"iou7saa4asnmgypzdseocin0","name":"Coffex Istanbul 2026","description":"The 8th Istanbul Coffee Expo brings trade buyers and equipment suppliers to Lütfi Kırdar Congress Centre for three days of B2B networking.

So it may be a surprise to learn that in 2026, Bangkok can lay claim to being one of the most impressive coffee capitals in the world.\n\nWhat makes Bangkok such a compelling city for coffee nerds? The overwhelming majority of shops roast their own beans, often maintaining direct farm relationships with producers in the mountainous north, particularly around Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai. It isn't just domestic origins either; you'll find single-origin offerings from across the globe, with Ethiopian, Panamanian and Colombian lots sitting comfortably alongside homegrown Thai and Lao varieties.\n\nExpect each shop to stock a minimum of two different roasts for espresso. It's not uncommon for even the smallest, most humble independent outlet to have three beans loaded in grinders at any given time. The roast spectrum skews lighter than you might expect, with medium and light-medium profiles dominating. Anaerobic fermentation, carbonic maceration and experimental naturals all feature prominently.\n\nThe interiors are just as varied. Ultra-modern, glass-fronted architectural showcases sit alongside stripped-back, raw-concrete aesthetics and more traditional, warmly furnished shopfronts. The design ambition on display often rivals dedicated studio spaces rather than mere cafés.\n\nRegional and national chains have also flourished. Operators like 1:2, BEANS and Roots have become ubiquitous fixtures across the capital's numerous malls, though the line between chain and independent is far less stark than in most Western cities. The term \"speciality\" doesn't hold much relevance in Bangkok as a differentiator among scores of shops. The quality floor is already so high that the label is practically redundant. Great coffee isn't confined to the core tourist and expat hubs around Sukhumvit, Silom and Songwat either. Vast selections of quality shops in areas like Bang Na and Chatuchak demonstrate just how widespread the city's appetite for coffee runs.\n\nDespite the city's reputation for affordability, prices for coffee can rival what you might expect to pay in Europe. Imported lighter roasts in particular command significant premiums, and a single pour-over from a sought-after lot can comfortably exceed what you'd spend in London or Berlin.\n\nIf any criticism could be drawn, it would be that the city's coffee culture keeps early hours. You may struggle after 4PM to find a quality cup outside of kiosk outlets within the malls. This isn't unique to Bangkok — Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei all follow a similar pattern — but it catches out visitors accustomed to European evening café culture.\n\nNone of this is commercialised to appeal to the Western visitor's palate. There's a voracious domestic demand, and like most aspects of Thai culture, there is none of the pretentiousness which can plague speciality coffee in the West. As a coffee purist, you almost have to recalibrate your instincts. Shops pairing espresso with orange juice, infusing drinks with all manner of toppings and syrups. These aren't red flags here. The same counter serving a lurid orange-topped iced latte may also pour you one of the finest washed, anaerobically fermented filter cups you've ever tasted.","population":null,"timezone":null,"coordinates":[{"lat":13.81096602890625,"lng":100.3023765796875},{"lat":13.64681357890625,"lng":100.3150635396875},{"lat":13.64723003890625,"lng":100.3232325796875},{"lat":13.63141654890625,"lng":100.32496628968751},{"lat":13.60935714890625,"lng":100.3572637196875},{"lat":13.58007789890625,"lng":100.35807188968751},{"lat":13.53543208890625,"lng":100.3766770696875},{"lat":13.53921443890625,"lng":100.39843253968749},{"lat":13.526273928906251,"lng":100.4037688596875},{"lat":13.48531894890625,"lng":100.3870272996875},{"lat":13.16737527890625,"lng":100.44120966968751},{"lat":13.473791278906251,"lng":100.44139039968749},{"lat":13.535448588906249,"lng":100.43059026968751},{"lat":13.59295229890625,"lng":100.44082642968749},{"lat":13.592771568906251,"lng":100.45207249968749},{"lat":13.57831162890625,"lng":100.4583998096875},{"lat":13.59330759890625,"lng":100.4756965396875},{"lat":13.59684288890625,"lng":100.4934000496875},{"lat":13.58289862890625,"lng":100.50434570968751},{"lat":13.592021698906251,"lng":100.5148300296875},{"lat":13.617846948906251,"lng":100.5073544296875},{"lat":13.66954144890625,"lng":100.5141222896875},{"lat":13.66519622890625,"lng":100.5430659296875},{"lat":13.70311245890625,"lng":100.5538100696875},{"lat":13.686946308906249,"lng":100.5883549096875},{"lat":13.66248076890625,"lng":100.5789882996875},{"lat":13.638621878906251,"lng":100.6402739196875},{"lat":13.64362247890625,"lng":100.6570691596875},{"lat":13.66593652890625,"lng":100.6626351596875},{"lat":13.648134458906249,"lng":100.7098401196875},{"lat":13.697746768906251,"lng":100.7253549596875},{"lat":13.71444718890625,"lng":100.72275356968751},{"lat":13.71663431890625,"lng":100.7297903796875},{"lat":13.71467279890625,"lng":100.80892008968749},{"lat":13.68474971890625,"lng":100.8869790596875},{"lat":13.695658198906251,"lng":100.8823810596875},{"lat":13.79596620890625,"lng":100.9426190396875},{"lat":13.82209527890625,"lng":100.9741759496875},{"lat":13.84833302890625,"lng":100.9402038796875},{"lat":13.85786738890625,"lng":100.9456538296875},{"lat":13.85943686890625,"lng":100.9374679596875},{"lat":13.96719011890625,"lng":100.9472665396875},{"lat":13.95108006890625,"lng":100.81351137968751},{"lat":13.93669030890625,"lng":100.7696459096875},{"lat":13.93426414890625,"lng":100.6972237796875},{"lat":13.95051323890625,"lng":100.7004614096875},{"lat":13.95080572890625,"lng":100.64715496968749},{"lat":13.957470958906251,"lng":100.6454704296875},{"lat":13.95814305890625,"lng":100.6290245496875},{"lat":13.97000974890625,"lng":100.6287704496875},{"lat":13.97704941890625,"lng":100.61581013968751},{"lat":13.97512639890625,"lng":100.60655572968751},{"lat":13.964868678906251,"lng":100.60798308968751},{"lat":13.97643407890625,"lng":100.5731171596875},{"lat":13.97287392890625,"lng":100.5660771596875},{"lat":13.86106211890625,"lng":100.5397946396875},{"lat":13.83447984890625,"lng":100.50204153968751},{"lat":13.82420815890625,"lng":100.4996589396875},{"lat":13.82089979890625,"lng":100.5082617096875},{"lat":13.80724604890625,"lng":100.4929814996875},{"lat":13.79433798890625,"lng":100.4548310796875},{"lat":13.80052119890625,"lng":100.4586122196875},{"lat":13.804448638906251,"lng":100.4464510596875},{"lat":13.81096602890625,"lng":100.3023765796875}],"postal_code":null,"createdAt":"2025-12-01T14:10:10.674Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T07:05:47.629Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-16T07:05:47.701Z","country_name":null,"media_links":{"youtube_videos":[],"instagram_posts":[],"additional_links":[]},"featured_video_url":null,"comingSoon":false,"beta":true,"inFocus":true,"headline":null,"coffee_guide_articles":null,"rating_stars":5,"slug":null,"statement":null},"image":{"id":1290,"documentId":"yvdtjkroh2wx3eyq3eib6xgp","name":"ACRC-2026-Website-Banner.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".png","url":"https://helpful-oasis-8bb949e05d.media.strapiapp.com/large_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817625099.png","hash":"large_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817625099","mime":"image/png","name":"large_ACRC-2026-Website-Banner.png","path":null,"size":587.78,"width":1000,"height":563,"sizeInBytes":587775},"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://helpful-oasis-8bb949e05d.media.strapiapp.com/small_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817625099.png","hash":"small_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817625099","mime":"image/png","name":"small_ACRC-2026-Website-Banner.png","path":null,"size":175.04,"width":500,"height":281,"sizeInBytes":175044},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://helpful-oasis-8bb949e05d.media.strapiapp.com/medium_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817625099.png","hash":"medium_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817625099","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_ACRC-2026-Website-Banner.png","path":null,"size":354.9,"width":750,"height":422,"sizeInBytes":354902},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://helpful-oasis-8bb949e05d.media.strapiapp.com/thumbnail_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817625099.png","hash":"thumbnail_ACRC_2026_Website_Banner_e817

So it may be a surprise to learn that in 2026, Bangkok can lay claim to being one of the most impressive coffee capitals in the world.\n\nWhat makes Bangkok such a compelling city for coffee nerds? The overwhelming majority of shops roast their own beans, often maintaining direct farm relationships with producers in the mountainous north, particularly around Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai. It isn't just domestic origins either; you'll find single-origin offerings from across the globe, with Ethiopian, Panamanian and Colombian lots sitting comfortably alongside homegrown Thai and Lao varieties.\n\nExpect each shop to stock a minimum of two different roasts for espresso. It's not uncommon for even the smallest, most humble independent outlet to have three beans loaded in grinders at any given time. The roast spectrum skews lighter than you might expect, with medium and light-medium profiles dominating. Anaerobic fermentation, carbonic maceration and experimental naturals all feature prominently.\n\nThe interiors are just as varied. Ultra-modern, glass-fronted architectural showcases sit alongside stripped-back, raw-concrete aesthetics and more traditional, warmly furnished shopfronts. The design ambition on display often rivals dedicated studio spaces rather than mere cafés.\n\nRegional and national chains have also flourished. Operators like 1:2, BEANS and Roots have become ubiquitous fixtures across the capital's numerous malls, though the line between chain and independent is far less stark than in most Western cities. The term \"speciality\" doesn't hold much relevance in Bangkok as a differentiator among scores of shops. The quality floor is already so high that the label is practically redundant. Great coffee isn't confined to the core tourist and expat hubs around Sukhumvit, Silom and Songwat either. Vast selections of quality shops in areas like Bang Na and Chatuchak demonstrate just how widespread the city's appetite for coffee runs.\n\nDespite the city's reputation for affordability, prices for coffee can rival what you might expect to pay in Europe. Imported lighter roasts in particular command significant premiums, and a single pour-over from a sought-after lot can comfortably exceed what you'd spend in London or Berlin.\n\nIf any criticism could be drawn, it would be that the city's coffee culture keeps early hours. You may struggle after 4PM to find a quality cup outside of kiosk outlets within the malls. This isn't unique to Bangkok — Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei all follow a similar pattern — but it catches out visitors accustomed to European evening café culture.\n\nNone of this is commercialised to appeal to the Western visitor's palate. There's a voracious domestic demand, and like most aspects of Thai culture, there is none of the pretentiousness which can plague speciality coffee in the West. As a coffee purist, you almost have to recalibrate your instincts. Shops pairing espresso with orange juice, infusing drinks with all manner of toppings and syrups. These aren't red flags here. The same counter serving a lurid orange-topped iced latte may also pour you one of the finest washed, anaerobically fermented filter cups you've ever
