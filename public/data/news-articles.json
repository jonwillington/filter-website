Coffee","story":"The title came in a blind knockout: national champions brew five espressos each, judged without knowing who made them. Kissick also won the 2023 UK Barista Championship and placed sixth at the 2024 Worlds in Busan. Head roaster Nicholas Pastellopoulos is a Q grader and SCA Authorized Trainer, and barista Haruka Nango won the 2024 UK Latte Art Championship.\n\nFrom Magherafelt in Northern Ireland, Kissick discovered specialty coffee at Workshop in Fitzrovia before opening on Butler Place in March 2019. Projects Office designed the 80-square-metre flatiron corner: a curved black bar echoes the building's shape, bespoke terrazzo counters sit on black terrazzo floors, and an orange ceiling is the sole colour accent.","website":"https://formative.coffee","createdAt":"2026-01-22T08:24:22.759Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T03:39:33.575Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-10T03:39:33.657Z","instagram":"formativecoffee","tiktok":null,"Founder":"Ian Kissick","type":"independent","description":null,"founded":"2019-03-01","hq":null,"whatsapp":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"has_wifi":false,"has_food":null,"has_outdoor_space":false,"is_pet_friendly":false,"has_espresso":true,"has_aeropress":null,"has_v60":true,"has_chemex":null,"has_cold_brew":null,"has_batch_brew":null,"roastOwnBeans":true,"ownRoastDesc":"Nicholas Pastellopoulos serves as head roaster and Q Arabica grader, handling green buying and roast development.

All beans are hand-roasted in small batches at the original Nairobi roastery in the Spring Valley neighbourhood, where one of Kenya's first coffee estates was planted in 1905.\n\nThe London shop on Camden Passage is their first location outside Kenya, joining eight Nairobi cafes. They pay farmers 25-30% above market rate through forward contracts. Inside the 1909 building, exposed red brick was chosen to echo Kenyan soil, wood to mirror the coffee trees, and metal to reference processing tools. Framed photographs of Kenyan coffee harvests line the walls, and African artists' work rotates through the space. All espresso is served as doubles, with batch brew and pour over roasted separately.","website":"https://www.springvalleycoffee.com","createdAt":"2026-02-08T03:46:35.584Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-08T04:07:13.304Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-08T04:07:13.398Z","instagram":"springvalleycoffee_london","tiktok":null,"Founder":null,"type":"independent","description":null,"founded":null,"hq":null,"whatsapp":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"has_wifi":false,"has_food":false,"has_outdoor_space":false,"is_pet_friendly":false,"has_espresso":false,"has_aeropress":false,"has_v60":false,"has_chemex":false,"has_cold_brew":false,"has_batch_brew":false,"roastOwnBeans":false,"ownRoastDesc":null,"ownBeanLink":null,"role":"shop","oatMilk":false,"plantMilk":false,"price":null,"source_articles":[],"awards":[],"youtube":null,"line":null,"has_siphon":false,"specializes_light":false,"specializes_medium":false,"specializes_dark":false,"equipment":{},"isDev":false,"quality_tier":"draft","research":{"facts":[{"claim":"Kenya's

Founder Varatt Vichit-Vadakan, the 2014 Thailand Barista Champion, launched Roots in 2013 with head roaster Korn Sanguenkeaw and experience specialist Somdej Luengtaviboon.\n\nThe roastery works exclusively with Thai beans from eight farming families across Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Tak, and Mae Hong Son. A cup-to-farm programme returns revenue to origin communities. Single origins include Sanchai, Pangkhon Village, Aten from Mae Daet Noi, and Chang Pao from Le Tor Glo. The House Blend combines 65% Pangkhon Black Honey with Mae Suay and Kenya-washed Pangkhon lots.","website":"https://rootsbkk.com","createdAt":"2025-12-11T11:30:52.905Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-08T03:08:53.053Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-08T03:08:53.105Z","instagram":"rootsbkk","tiktok":null,"Founder":"Varatt Vichit-Vadakan (Tae), Korn Sanguenkeaw, and Somdej Luengtaviboon","type":"smallChain","description":null,"founded":"2013-01-01","hq":null,"whatsapp":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"has_wifi":true,"has_food":true,"has_outdoor_space":null,"is_pet_friendly":null,"has_espresso":true,"has_aeropress":null,"has_v60":true,"has_chemex":null,"has_cold_brew":true,"has_batch_brew":true,"roastOwnBeans":true,"ownRoastDesc":"Boutique micro roastery.

Founder Varatt Vichit-Vadakan, the 2014 Thailand Barista Champion, launched Roots in 2013 with head roaster Korn Sanguenkeaw and experience specialist Somdej Luengtaviboon.\n\nThe roastery works exclusively with Thai beans from eight farming families across Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Tak, and Mae Hong Son. A cup-to-farm programme returns revenue to origin communities. Single origins include Sanchai, Pangkhon Village, Aten from Mae Daet Noi, and Chang Pao from Le Tor Glo. The House Blend combines 65% Pangkhon Black Honey with Mae Suay and Kenya-washed Pangkhon lots.","website":"https://rootsbkk.com","createdAt":"2025-12-11T11:30:52.905Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-08T03:08:53.053Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-08T03:08:53.105Z","instagram":"rootsbkk","tiktok":null,"Founder":"Varatt Vichit-Vadakan (Tae), Korn Sanguenkeaw, and Somdej Luengtaviboon","type":"smallChain","description":null,"founded":"2013-01-01","hq":null,"whatsapp":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"has_wifi":true,"has_food":true,"has_outdoor_space":null,"is_pet_friendly":null,"has_espresso":true,"has_aeropress":null,"has_v60":true,"has_chemex":null,"has_cold_brew":true,"has_batch_brew":true,"roastOwnBeans":true,"ownRoastDesc":"Boutique micro roastery.
